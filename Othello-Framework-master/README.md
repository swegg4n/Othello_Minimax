# Othello FX Framework 
![OthelloFX Logo](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/logo.png)




> Othello game framework which can be used as a platform for testing Othello AI Agents as well as just a normal Othello game.
	



## Description

This is an an Othello/Riversi game made in Java using JavaFX GUI Framework. 
The game allows you to implement and add your own AI agents which you will then be able to test and play againts. OthelloFX comes with 3 different Agent implementations purposefully excluding the usual ones such as MiniMax which you will have to implement on your own. The framework can run in multiple modes:

* Human Player vs Human Player
* Humna Player vs AI Agent
* AI Agent vs AI Agent.

## Getting Started

Refer to the main folder in order to find the documented files you need. There you will see the [User Settings](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/main/UserSettings.java) file, the [Agent Manager](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/main/AgentManager.java) in which you will run your agent/s, as well as various example agents and implementations. Take a look at the [Agent Controller](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/com/eudycontreras/othello/controllers/AgentController.java) for useful static methods, etc


#### Agent Move

Implement a move if necessary or use the existing implementation. A move must extend from [Agent Move](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/com/eudycontreras/othello/capsules/AgentMove.java) and implement the compareTo and the IsValid methods. In those methods you define what makes a move better than the other as well as how you define a move as valid. Take a look at [Move Wrapper](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/com/eudycontreras/othello/capsules/MoveWrapper.java) for an example of how a move is implemented. Only the isValid and the compareTo method are needed by the framework but as you can see you can also create your own helper methods.


> Example Move class which extends from AgentMove
```java

public class ExampleMove extends AgentMove{

	public ExampleMove() {	
	}

	@Override
	public int compareTo(AgentMove move) {
		return 0;
	}

	@Override
	public boolean isValid() {
		return false;
	}
}

```


#### AI Agent

Your agent must extend from the [Agent](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/com/eudycontreras/othello/controllers/Agent.java) which is a simple POJO containing important information used for determining how good your move algorithm performs, along with other information regarding the move search. The constructor of an *AgentMove* allows the turn/type to be specified as well as a name in case you wish to give your agent a name.


> Example Agent class which extends from Agent
```java

public class ExampleAgent extends Agent{

	@Override
	public AgentMove getMove(GameBoardState gameState) {
		return yourMove();
	}
}

```



#### Agent Manager

The [Agent Manager](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/main/AgentManager.java) is the class you will use to run your agent/s. In order to run your agent/s simply create an instance of your agent and pass it through the second parametter of the of the Othello constructor just how it is shown below. The game manager will allow you to pass one or two agents. The first agent must always be PlayerOne while the second must always be PlayerTwo. The player type is determine by the turn. Player one always starts. 

> Agent Manager and main launcher application
```java

public class AgentManager extends Application{

	@Override
	public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
		new Othello(primaryStage, new ExampleAgent("Some Name", PlayerTurn.PLAYER_ONE));
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		launch(args);
	}
}

```



#### Notes


Take a look at the [Agent Controller](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/com/eudycontreras/othello/controllers/AgentController.java) to see a variety of helper methods as well as various implementations of different dumb and smart agents. There are other utility classes which might be of help. Explore the utilities package!



#### Customization


The [User Settings](https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX-Framework/blob/master/Othello%20FX%20Edu/src/main/UserSettings.java) allows you to modify a variety of settings. Here you have a description of each setting.

There are some things which I plan to add to the framework. These things will be shown here along with popular demands

> - [ ] **More options to the main menu so that users have more control through the interface**.
> - [ ] **Maybe an online multiplayer option for users to test their agents remotely in competitions**
